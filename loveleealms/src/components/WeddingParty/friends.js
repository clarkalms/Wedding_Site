        position: 'Best Man',
        info: "Dave is Clark's cousin. He's the one with the beard. Both Dave and Clark place a high priority on fashion and quality coffee. They can be seen regularly 'suiting up' and meeting for a pour-over at an array of cafes or a Chicago brew at a local pub."

        picture: Bryan,
        name: 'BRYAN HILL',
        position: 'Groomsman',
        info: "Clark's older (Bryan prefers the term 'better looking') brother. Bryan is everything Clark could want in a brother, except for location. He lives way too far away. These two are more alike than either of them might admit. However, the one thing they can agree on is that 'Dad Jokes' are the best jokes."

        info: "Clark met Alex while working in the restaurant industry in Chicago. After several years and trips around the world (including a spontaneous visit to Michelangelo's statue of David... from a car), the only thing that can keep these two apart is the Atlantic ocean, and even that doesn't always work."

        position: 'Groomswoman',
        info: "Rhey-Ann and Clark have been friends since his days at Starbucks over a decade ago. She used her professional black belt skills to teach him self defence but conveniently left out just enough instruction so she can still kick his butt."

        name: 'BEI LI',
        position: 'Maid of Honor',
